== About Eventuate Tram

Eventuate Tram is a framework for link:./distributed-data-management.html[managing distributed data] in a microservice architecture.
It enables a Java application to send and receive messages as part of an database transaction.
It does this by implementing the https://microservices.io/patterns/data/application-events.html[Transactional outbox pattern].
This pattern is foundation of maintaining data consistency within a microservice architecture.
It is used to implement the https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html[Saga pattern], which implements transactions multiple services, and the https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html[CQRS pattern], which implements queries that retrieve data from multiple services.

Eventuate Tram provides several messaging abstractions:

* messaging - send and receive messages over named channels
* events - publish and consume domain events
* commands - asynchronously invoke a service by sending a command message and receiving a reply message

=== The architecture of an Eventuate Tram application

The following diagram shows the architecture of the https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-examples-java-spring-todo-list[Eventuate Tram Todo application]:

The application consists of two application services:

* `Todo Service` - implements the REST endpoints for creating, updating and deleting todos.
The service persists the Todo JPA entity in MySQL.
Using `Eventuate Tram`, it publishes `Todo` domain events.

* `Todo View Service` - implements a REST endpoint for querying the `Todos`.
It maintains a CQRS view of the `Todos` in ElasticSearch.
The `Todo View Service` subscribes to the events using Eventuate Tram and updates ElasticSearch.

The `Todo Service` publishes events using Eventuate Tram, which  inserts events into the `MESSAGE` table as part of the ACID transaction that updates the `TODO` table.
The Eventuate Tram CDC service reads messages inserted into the `MESSAGE` table using either https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transaction-log-tailing.html[Transaction log tailing] or https://microservices.io/patterns/data/polling-publisher.html[Polling] and publishes them to a message broker, such as Apache Kafka.

=== About Eventuate Tram Sagas

https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-sagas[Eventuate Tram sagas] builds on Eventuate Tram to provide https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html[orchestration-based sagas].
Instead of simply relying on services to respond to domain events, you define a saga orchestrator, which tells the saga participants what operations to execute.
To understand the difference between choreography using domain events and orchestration, please read this https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html[article] and see this https://www.slideshare.net/chris.e.richardson/yow2018-events-and-commands-developing-asynchronous-microservices[presentation].
