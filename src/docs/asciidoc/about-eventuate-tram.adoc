= About Eventuate Tram

The Eventuate Tram framework enables a Java/Spring application to send messages as part of an database transaction.
This enables an application atomically update state and send a message or a domain event.
It is a foundation of maintaining data consistency within a microservice architecture.

Eventuate Tram is a framework developing asynchronous microservices that use the the traditional JDBC/JPA-based persistence model.
Unlike /whyeventsourcing.html[event sourcing], adding Eventuate Tram to your Spring/Sprint Boot application requires minimal changes.

Eventuate Tram provides several messaging abstractions:

* messaging - send and receive messages over named channels
* events - publish domain events and subscribe to domain events
* commands - asynchronously send a command to a service and receive a reply

== The architecture of an Eventuate Tram application

The following diagram shows the architecture of the https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-examples-java-spring-todo-list[Eventuate Tram Todo application]:

<img src="https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-examples-java-spring-todo-list/raw/master/images/Architecture.png" class="img-responsive">

The application consists of two services:

* `Todo Service` - implements the REST endpoints for creating, updating and deleting todos.
The service persists the Todo JPA entity in MySQL.
Using `Eventuate Tram`, it publishes Todo domain events that are consumed by the `Todo View Service`.

* `Todo View Service` - implements a REST endpoint for querying the todos.
It maintains a CQRS view of the todos in ElasticSearch.

The `Todo Service` publishes events using Eventuate Tram.
Eventuate Tram inserts events into the `MESSAGE` table as part of the ACID transaction that updates the TODO table.
The Eventuate Tram CDC service tracks inserts into the `MESSAGE` table using the MySQL binlog and publishes messages to Apache Kafka.
The `Todo View Service` subscribes to the events and updates ElasticSearch.

== About Eventuate Tram Sagas

https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-sagas[Eventuate Tram sagas] builds on Eventuate Tram to provide orchestration-based sagas.
Instead of simply relying on services to respond to domain events, you define a saga orchestrator, which tells the saga participants what operations to execute.
To understand the difference between choreography using domain events and orchestration, please see this http://microservices.io/microservices/news/2017/12/04/qconsf2017-presentation.html[presentation].
