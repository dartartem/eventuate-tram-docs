= What's new

The version of the Eventuate CDC service (WIP CDC, Eventuate Local 0.30.0.M12, Eventuate Tram 0.20.0.M8) has numerous new features:

* Multi-reader/multi-pipeline support - rather than reading from either a single Eventuate Local `EVENTS` table or Eventuate Tram `MESSAGE` table, the new CDC can read from multiple `EVENTS` and/or `MESSAGE` tables.
This enables, for example, the FTGO application to run a single CDC service instead of two separate CDC services.
It also enables a single CDC service to support the scenario where each service has its own `EVENTS` or `MESSAGE` table.

* Support for Apache ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, Redis - Eventuate Tram applications can now use Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ.

* Improved observability
** Health Check endpoint - the CDC service now implements a Spring Boot Actuator-based Health check endpoint
** CDC service metrics - the CDC service uses Spring Boot Actuator to expose Prometheus metrics
